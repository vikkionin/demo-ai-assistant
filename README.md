## Running it yourself

### Snowflake backend setup

1. Open the worksheet at `snowflake/initial_setup.sql` in Snowflake and run it.

1. Open the notebook at `snowflake/populate_st_assistant_data.ipynb` in Snowflake and follow the
   instructions in there.

### Try the app on your machine

1. Get the code:

   ```sh
   $ git clone https://github.com/streamlit/demo-ai-assistant
   ```

1. Start a virtual environment and get the dependencies (requires uv):

   ```sh
   $ uv venv
   $ .venv/bin/activate
   $ uv sync
   ```

1. Add your Snowflake account to `.streamlit/secrets.toml` under `[connections.snowflake]`

   ```toml
   [connections.snowflake]
   account = "YOUR_ACCOUNT_GOES_HERE" # <-- Change this
   # This is the user we set up for you in the pipeline setup steps:
   user = "ST_ASSISTANT_USER"
   # In the Snowflake UI, create an API token for the user above and paste here:
   password = "PASTE_TOKEN_HERE" # <-- Change this
   # Everything below was already set up in the pipeline steps:
   role = "ST_ASSISTANT_USER"
   warehouse = "COMPUTE_WH"
   database = "ST_ASSISTANT_DEV"
   schema = "PUBLIC"
   ```
